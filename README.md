# 👋 Hi, I'm Alishba Andleeb
**AI Automation Engineer | 2+ Years Experience | Backend Systems | Workflow & Data Pipelines**

I build **production-grade automation and data systems** that connect APIs, process events in real time, generate business intelligence, and trigger intelligent alerts. My strength is combining **AI, backend engineering, and workflow orchestration** to reduce manual effort and operational risk.

My focus is on **AI-driven automation systems**:
- Workflow orchestration & event-driven pipelines
- Backend APIs for data processing and analysis
- Real-time metrics, monitoring, and alerting
- Applied ML inside production systems

- API-to-API automation
- Event-driven architectures
- Intelligent alerting systems

### 🧠 Backend Engineering
- FastAPI (clean endpoints, validation, business logic)
- Flask (ML-powered REST APIs)
- PostgreSQL (schema design, metrics, alert history)
- Async/background processing

### 📊 Data Pipelines & BI
- Real-time data ingestion
- Metric aggregation & KPIs
- Anomaly detection (rule-based + statistical)
- Monitoring operational health

### 🧪 Applied Machine Learning
- CNN-based feature extraction (ResNet50)
- Similarity search using k-NN
- ML model integration into backend systems
- Performance-optimized inference pipelines
